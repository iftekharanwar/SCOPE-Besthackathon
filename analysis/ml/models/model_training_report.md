## Implementation Notes

The ML model was trained using synthetic department assignments based on business rules with adjusted thresholds to create a diverse set of classes. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with actual historical routing decisions.

## Recommendations

1. Use the trained model for claim routing in the application
2. Implement a hybrid approach that combines ML predictions with business rules for edge cases
3. Consider adding a confidence threshold to fall back to rule-based routing when ML confidence is low
4. Periodically retrain the model as new data becomes available
5. Monitor model performance in production to ensure continued accuracy

# Dataset Analysis for ML-Based Claim Routing

## Dataset Overview
- Total records: 237648
- Features: 12

## Key Findings

### Feature Importance
The most important features for claim routing are:
- POLICYHOLDER_AGE: 0.0000
- POLICYHOLDER_GENDER: 0.0000
- WARRANTY: 0.0000
- CLAIM_REGION: 0.0000
- CLAIM_PROVINCE: 0.0000

### Department Distribution
The distribution of departments based on our simulated rules:
- Standard Claims: 237648 claims (100.0%)

### Correlations
Significant correlations between features:
- CLAIM_AMOUNT_PAID and PREMIUM_AMOUNT_PAID: 0.38

## Recommendations for ML Model

Based on the analysis, we recommend:

1. Using Random Forest as the primary model due to the mix of categorical and numerical features
2. Including all features in the initial model, with special attention to the top 5 important features
3. Implementing a hybrid approach that combines ML predictions with business rules for edge cases
4. Using stratified sampling during training to handle any class imbalance in department assignments
5. Creating derived features from the claim date (year, month) to capture seasonal patterns
6. Considering ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy

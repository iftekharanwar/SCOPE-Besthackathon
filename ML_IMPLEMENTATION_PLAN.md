# ML-Based Claim Routing Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to enhance the SCOPE Assistant with machine learning capabilities for more accurate and data-driven claim routing decisions.

## Current System
The current system uses rule-based routing with predefined thresholds and business logic to assign claims to departments. While effective, this approach lacks the adaptability and pattern recognition capabilities of machine learning.

## Proposed ML Enhancement

### 1. Data Preparation
- Load and preprocess the BEST Hackathon dataset
- Extract relevant features for training:
  - Policyholder age
  - Claim amount
  - Premium amount
  - Vehicle brand
  - Warranty type
  - Claim region
- Create target variable (department assignment) based on historical data or simulated optimal assignments

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Convert categorical variables (vehicle brand, warranty type, region) to numerical representations
- Normalize numerical features
- Handle missing values with appropriate strategies
- Create derived features (e.g., claim-to-premium ratio)

### 3. Model Selection and Training
- Implement multiple classification models:
  - Random Forest Classifier (primary model)
  - XGBoost (alternative model)
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Train models on prepared dataset
- Evaluate using cross-validation
- Select best performing model based on accuracy, precision, and recall

### 4. Integration with Existing System
- Create a new `ml_routing_engine.py` module
- Implement model prediction functionality
- Add confidence score for ML predictions
- Create hybrid routing system that:
  - Uses ML for routing when confidence is high
  - Falls back to rule-based routing when confidence is low
  - Incorporates fraud detection from existing system

### 5. Evaluation and Refinement
- Compare ML routing decisions with rule-based decisions
- Analyze edge cases and potential improvements
- Implement feedback loop for continuous model improvement

## Implementation Timeline
1. Data preparation and feature engineering (1 day)
2. Model training and evaluation (1 day)
3. Integration with existing system (1 day)
4. Testing and refinement (1 day)

## Expected Benefits
- More accurate claim routing based on historical patterns
- Adaptability to changing claim patterns over time
- Improved efficiency in claim processing
- Enhanced fraud detection capabilities
- Data-driven insights for business process improvement

## Technical Requirements
- scikit-learn for model implementation
- pandas for data manipulation
- joblib for model serialization
- Additional visualization libraries for model evaluation

## Success Metrics
- Routing accuracy improvement over rule-based system
- Processing time reduction
- Adjuster satisfaction with routing decisions
- Reduction in manual reassignments

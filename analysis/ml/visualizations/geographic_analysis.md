# Geographic Analysis of Insurance Claims

## Claim Density by Region
This visualization shows the number of claims filed in each region. Regions with higher claim volumes may require dedicated teams or additional resources. This information helps in strategic resource allocation and regional office planning.

## Average Claim Amount by Region
This chart displays the average claim amount for each region. Regions with higher average claim amounts may indicate more complex claims or higher-value insured assets. This information can guide pricing strategies and risk assessment by region.

## Risk Score by Region
The risk score is a composite metric calculated from claim frequency, average amount, variability, and maximum claim amount. Regions with higher risk scores may require more careful underwriting and claim investigation. This metric helps identify geographic areas with potentially higher insurance risk.

## Fraud Probability by Region
This visualization shows the estimated fraud probability for each region based on various risk factors. Regions with higher fraud probability scores may require enhanced fraud detection measures and more thorough claim investigations. This information helps focus fraud prevention resources where they are most needed.

## Region-Department Assignment Heatmap
This heatmap shows how claims from different regions are distributed across departments. It helps identify patterns in claim routing and potential regional specialization needs. For example, some regions may have a higher proportion of claims routed to specialized departments like Legal Claims or High Value Claims.
